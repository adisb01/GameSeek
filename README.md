# GameSeek

This was designed as the final project for CIS 195: iOS Mobile App Development. It's an app that allows users to sign up with accounts to view games around their location on a live and interactive map, as well as posting pickup games of various sports to play at certain times. Users can click on an icon (which designates the sport) on the map to bring up details about the game description, time, who is attending, and an option to join/leave.
